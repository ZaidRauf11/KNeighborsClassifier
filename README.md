# K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) Classifier

This repository contains a simple implementation of a **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) Classifier** using Python and scikit-learn.  
It demonstrates how to train, evaluate, and visualize a KNN model for basic classification tasks.

## 📌 **Project Description**

In this project, I trained a KNN Classifier on the popular **Iris dataset** to predict the species of iris flowers based on sepal and petal measurements.

The project includes:
- Data loading and preprocessing
- Model training with scikit-learn
- Model evaluation using accuracy and F1-score
- Hyperparameter tuning for `k` neighbors
